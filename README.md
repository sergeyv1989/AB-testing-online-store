# Online store A/B testing

In this project I will analyze A/B testing results for the marketing department of an online store. 

The data is compiled from:
- Hypotheses on boosting the online store's revenue and their properties.
- The visits made during the A/B testing period.
- The orders made during the A/B testing period.

The main goal is to optimize the marketing expenses by concluding if one of the test groups is leading in conversion rate and order size.

The main steps will be:
- Loading the data while optimizing the data types.
- Exploring the data to learn its contents and to identify issues with its quality that should be addressed.
- Preparing the data for analysis by treating the discovered issues.
- Prioritizing the hypotheses.
- Analyzing the results of the A/B test.
- Summarizing the findings and producing business decisions.
